#+title: Fast latex previews in Org

Needs testing!

Requires auctex/preview-latex.

To use, turn on =org-auctex-mode= in an org buffer. This replaces your binding for =org-latex-preview= (~C-c C-x C-l~ by default) with =org-auctex-preview-dwim=.

=org-auctex-preview-dwim= is a drop-in replacement for =org-latex-preview= (including the prefix argument behavior).

If you prefer more fine grained control, there are other commands for previewing at point, the section, buffer etc.
